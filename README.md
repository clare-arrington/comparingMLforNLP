# comparingMLforNLP
This project was an independent study where I compared different machine learning and deep learning structures on a sentiment analysis task. The methods covered were naive Bayes, support vector machines, a convolutional neural network, and a long short-term memory network.
I used this wine review dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) to perform binary classification on whether the wine was rated good or bad by the magazine.
